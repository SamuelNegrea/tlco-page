Here's a copy I've made of the company's website I worked for.

Once downloaded or cloned the project type "npm install" in your terminal to install the node_modules.

Once done that, type in your terminal "ng serve". In case you haven't installed angular cli already type npm install -g @angular/cli in the terminal before typing "ng serve".

Thank you,

Samuel.
